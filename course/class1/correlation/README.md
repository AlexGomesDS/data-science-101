## What are we doing here?

We are exploring correlation between features using the pandas
[Series.corr](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.corr.html) function.

You can look at correlation between any two things that have numeric values. Of particular interest for the iris dataset
will be to look at correlation between features and the target column.

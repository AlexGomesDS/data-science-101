# What are we doing here?

We use one of the most famous machine learning pre-processing tool, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique used to emphasize variation and bring out strong patterns in a dataset. Scikit-learn has an implementation of PCA that we can use: [`sklearn.decomposition.PCA`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html) 

It is important to note that as any tool it has its [limitations](http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_about_feature_scaling.html#the-effect-of-standardization-on-pca-in-a-pattern-classification-task) and one should be aware of them.

## Reason

I get lots of questions about how to get into the space. Some variations of the questions are the following

- I have a math / science background and would like to get into machine learning / data science but I don’t know where to start.
- I am a programmer and I’m interesting in what machine learning / data science is, how do I get started?
- I would like a job in data science but I don’t have any experience.

In order to give those of you asking this question a bit of an answer we are doing an interactive workshop.

## What is it

This meetup will be a 2 hour workshop that will attempt to provide an superficial but efficient overview into some common activities involved in doing data science and machine learning.

The output of this workshop will be a predictive model that YOU create. This is because in order to build a predictive model, you will need to do a bit of data science as well as use some packages that allow you to build a model.

To create a predictive model, the tasks involved are typically the following:

1. Investigate the data
  1. Single factor analysis
  1. Multi-factor analysis
2. Build a predictive model
  1. Select a model
  1. Train the model
  1. Evaluate it's quality
